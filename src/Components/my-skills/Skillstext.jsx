Iâ€™ve also worked with Tailwind CSS to streamline UI design. My backend understanding includes Node.js and Express, enabling me to build full-stack applications. I'm currently exploring blockchain technologies, learning how to develop decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts using Solidity. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and reflect my passion for clean code and user-friendly interfaces. I continuously strive to learn new tools and frameworks to grow as a developer and bring ideas to life.
